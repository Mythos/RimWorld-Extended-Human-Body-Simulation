# General information

This is an unofficial update of PhileasFogg's mod which can be found on the [Ludeon Forums](url=https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=34214.msg349406)

# Feature overview

## Additional body parts
The current human body simulation is rather limited. I expanded it with fibulas, patellas, ulnas, a spleen, two lobes for your pawns liver and a hidden intestine (which makes it possible to remove the stomach without killing the patient - because humans can live without a stomach; it's no fun but possible).

## Harvest and reintegrate all available body parts
Nearly every single body part is now harvestable (exceptions: torso, shoulders, head, neck, skull, intestine). So you can replace every part your pawns might miss with freshly harvested natural equivalent (which needs to be stored in a cold environment as natural body parts start to rot after one day). This also applies to all parts of the now expanded human body structure, which includes: fibulas, patellas, ulnas, a spleen and two lobes for your pawns liver.

## Replace missing bones with surrogates
Buy a surrogate to replace the missing bones. Your trusted exotic, pirate or combat merchant may have to offer some.
