# General information

This is an unofficial update of PhileasFogg's mod which can be found on the [Ludeon Forums](url=https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=34214.msg349406)

# Feature overview

## Additional body parts
The current human body simulation is rather limited. I expanded it with fibulas, patellas, ulnas, a spleen, two lobes for your pawns liver and a hidden intestine (which makes it possible to remove the stomach without killing the patient - because humans can live without a stomach; it's no fun but possible).

## Harvest and reintegrate all available body parts
Harvesting body parts were part of this mod, but have now been removed as the same functionality exists in [Harvest Everything!](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1500981707) which has been made compatible with this mod.

## Replace missing bones with surrogates
Buy a surrogate to replace the missing bones. Your trusted exotic, pirate or combat merchant may have to offer some.
